simpler
=======

A (probably too) simple JSON REST library for Java.

Goals
=====

Simpler is a very simple REST library for Java, using JSON for message encoding and Servlets for 
HTTP transport. 

Dependencies
============

Simpler uses GSON because I was already using it and didn't feel like switching to Jackson, which is
maybe better these days. There are no other explicit dependencies. Any Servlet container could be 
used.
